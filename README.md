## How to Connect

### Step 1: Install the Server

Choose your preferred method:

* One-click installation: Use the installation buttons above for Cursor and VS Code
* Manual installation: See detailed installation instructions for other clients in specific server pages

### Step 2: Authorize Access

* **Your MCP client** will redirect you to Avalara's secure login page
* **Sign in** with your Avalara credentials
* **Review permissions** - the client will request access to specific MCP server capabilities
* **Grant consent** - to complete the OAuth flow

### Step 3: Start Using

* **Cursor/VS Code**: Restart your editor or manually activate the server
* **Claude Desktop**: Connection is available immediately after authorization
* **Other clients**: Follow your client's specific activation instructions

## Troubleshooting
* Connection failed: Verify your Avalara account status and internet connection
* Permission denied: Check that your account has access to the requested services
* HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests): You've exceeded the rate limit for this server
  * Wait a few minutes before retrying
  * Check the server's rate limit details on its individual page
